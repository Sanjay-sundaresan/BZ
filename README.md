# Requirements: 
1. A google account 
2. Appropriate permissions to read the dataset. 


# Steps to run:
Note: The colab notebook installs all dependencies on the google compute engine as part of the runtime, so no pip requirements need to be satisified by the user.
1. Upload the 'test.rar' file in a new folder named 'DATA' in google drive. Ensure compliance with the name of the folder, and leave the file name unchanged.  
2. Click on the given Google Colab link after you're signed into the profile/google account which contains the dataset in drive. 
3. The notebook is divided into sections for clarity, so click the run button under 'Read Data' section. 
4. As it runs, click the arrow next to the 'Read Data' heading. 
5. You will be asked to authorize colab to connect to your drive. Confirm your consent. 
6. You may choose to run each cell after expanding every section, or run an entire section using the run button located at the left of the cell under the heading. 
7. To expand a section, simply click the arrow next to the section heading. 

Note: It is advised to expand the 'Read Data' section before running, in case you want to run the notebook from the beginning for a second time. 
Outputs for a section can be viewed after expanding it.
